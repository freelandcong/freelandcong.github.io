		<p>We're putting you where you need to be, please hold on a minute.<br>
		In the meantime, enjoy the lyrics to one of our original songs:</p>
		
		<p>There’s trouble in the world, disunity.<br>
		No matter where we live, no harmony.<br>
		There are people suffering, fighting for change.<br>
		But among God’s people, we trust in his name.</p>
		
		<p>(PRE-CHORUS)</p>
		
		<p>So we must stick close to his Word<br>
		And remain no part of this world</p>
		
		<p>(CHORUS)</p>
		
		<p>With love in ev’ry little thing we do.<br>
		Show love as we spread the good news,<br>
		And feel the love of the brotherhood.<br>
		Though we stand out as diff’rent,<br>
		With Jehovah, we are one.</p>
		
		<p>No matter where we go from sea to sea,<br>
		With God’s people, we find true family.<br>
		Yes, there are anxieties, but hope is real—<br>
		A paradise to come. True peace is near.</p>
		
		<p>(PRE-CHORUS)</p>
		
		<p>So we keep trusting in his Word<br>
		And remain no part of this world</p>
		
		<p>(CHORUS)</p>
		
		<p>With love in ev’ry little thing we do.<br>
		Show love as we spread the good news,<br>
		And feel the love of the brotherhood.<br>
		Though we stand out as diff’rent,<br>
		With Jehovah, we are one.<br>
		We are one.</p>
		
		<p>(PRE-CHORUS)</p>
		
		<p>So let’s stay faithful and endure<br>
		And remain no part of this world</p>
		
		<p>(CHORUS)</p>
		
		<p>With love in ev’ry little thing we do.<br>
		Show love as we spread the good news,<br>
		And feel the love of the brotherhood.<br>
		Though we stand out as diff’rent,<br>
		With Jehovah,</p>
		
		<p>(CHORUS)</p>
		
		<p>We love in ev’ry little thing we do.<br>
		Show love as we spread the good news,<br>
		And feel the love of the brotherhood.<br>
		Though we stand out as diff’rent,<br>
		With Jehovah, we are one.</p>
